  "description": "These chapters begin the story of the missionary efforts of the sons of Mosiah. Ammon and Lamoni take center stage, but the Lamanite woman Abish and her queen play key roles and Mormon emphasizes the contrasts between missionary and conversion experiences by paralleling the stories Ammon and Lamoni, Aaron and Lamoni’s father."

We are going to push a bit in approach with this lesson, use these scriptures to challenge us a touch. Kind of like how so many enjoy likening ourselves to Nephi, but what can we learn by likening ourselves to Laman and Lemuel?"

These chapters fit into the genre of “Testament”, which records the wisdom and blessings imparted by the patriarch of a family (unfortunately, we don’t have any records of  a matriarch sharing her wisdom or blessings that I know of). Alma’s counsel to his sons Helaman, Shiblon, and Corianton provide us some of his final words in the Book of Mormon (before he gives his final blessings and mysteriously disappears in Alma 45)."

  "description": "The Book of Alma concludes with a bang as we read of wars of multiple fronts and severe internal turmoil and dissent. We can learn a great deal from the behavior of Moroni, Helaman, and their armies. And of course we can’t forget the 2000 stripling warriors and their mothers! There are several embedded letters in these accounts, from which we can draw many lessons. Look for an underappreciated gem in Pahoran’s response to Moroni, which provides a powerful model of interpersonal communication, trust, and conflict resolution."

  "description": "These chapters give a literal chance to “feast upon the words of Christ” since they consist almost exclusively of Jesus’ teachings.

  "description": "These chapters of the Book of Mormon contain some of the most moving and tender moments in all of scripture. Jesus heals the sick, one by one. The crowd weeps with joy. Jesus blesses little children and the scene becomes ineffable. Angels minister to the children and Jesus weeps. All take the sacrament and Jesus teaches about prayer and fellowship. The people work all night to bring even more to the place where Jesus will return. Jesus offers a parallel to his “Intercessory Prayer” of John 16 and prays for oneness and purity, and all are united in this spiritual experience."

  "description": "These chapters function as a sermon and reflection about the scriptures. Jesus quotes from Isaiah 54 and Malachi 3-4. He recommends the writings of Isaiah and urges Nephi to supplement his own records. Then in a bittersweet twist, we are excluded from the climax of the story–Mormon tells us that Jesus reveals all things, that the mouths of children and infants are opened and they also teach the people. But he is forbidden to record these sublime teachings even though he wanted to."

Unfortunately,  we only read about that time period (which surpasses the time covered by Mosiah, Alma, Helaman, and 3 Nephi!) for eighteen brief verses. Why don’t we have more about this ideal period? How much could we learn from such a successful society? What can we apply from the details we have?"

  "description": "Poignantly placed after the description of the Lehite utopia, these are the darkest, most disturbing chapters in the Book of Mormon. It seems a fitting time to wrestle with the human potential for evil, the reality of the terrible things we do to each other, almost as a rule. And after reading his life’s work, we get to meet Mormon as a main character. He reluctantly leads the Nephites in battle, refuses, and then returns. This is the end of the Book of Mormon civilization. In addition, we also read a haunting letter that I don’t think Mormon actually intended to include in the Book of Mormon (If you notice, Mormoni has an inferiority complex and actually contributes very little to the Book of Mormon. Most of his content is letters from his dad and then he edits Ether because his dad said he would and never was able to). We will also look at what we learn from Mormon’s shining example in the midst of such terrible circumstances."

Too often we either ignore the idea of the Law of Consecration or we use it to discount our own needs, giving and giving until we are completely burned out. This episode emphasizes sustainable, transformative consecration.

Why do some of us not have many friends who aren’t members? This update explores the counterintuitive nature of missionary work, which is an on-the-ground demonstration of the paradoxical nature of the gospel. The best way to be a missionary is to not focus on being a missionary. Instead, effective missionary work stems from deeply internalized gospel living and authentic friendships."

  "description": "Jesus’ teachings get at the heart of the gospel: Be good. Be happy. Be whole. The tricky thing is, we humans are terrible at predicting what will make us happy and well, which is why it is so important to internalize the principles of the gospel. We become good as we practice goodness. When that goodness becomes who we are, we can’t lose."

  "description": "I think the most significant thing about Holy Week is that it fosters a holistic approach to Easter. It is not cheap celebration; it is full priced, high cost joy. It does not just celebrate life. It celebrates new, glorious, unexpected life after the agony of disappointment, betrayal, loss, rejection, and the death of everything we know."

In John, Jesus  declares himself the water of life, the light of the world, and the Good  Shepherd. Taken together, Jesus’ teachings challenge our  insider/outsider tribal thinking."

This episode explores the idea, ideal, and history of marriage, as well as what makes a good marriage on earth as it is in heaven.

In these chapters we see him as the powerful Messiah, coming into the seat of power triumphant yet humble and then standing up to corruption in the holiest most powerful institution of his day. These powerful actions drive home Jesus’ teachings that we should align our principles and practices, and live in such a way that we can peacefully explain to others the choices we make."
